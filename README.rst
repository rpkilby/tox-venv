What is tox-venv?
-----------------

tox-venv is a plugin that uses Python 3's builtin ``venv`` module for creating test environments, instead of creating
them with the ``virtualenv`` package. For Python versions that do not include ``venv`` (namely 3.2 and earlier), this
package does nothing and reverts to tox's default implementation.


Why use tox-venv?
-----------------

``virtualenv`` is historically Python 2/3 compatible, however to achieve this, it ships some files that are pinned at
their Python 2.6 version, such as the ``site`` module (see: `pypa/virtualenv#355`__). This has a few effects:

__ https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/355

- Builds using the ``-Werror`` option fail, as the deprecations are raised before the test suite can run.
- Users cannot take advantage of newer features of the ``site`` module in their test environments.
- Eventually, these deprecations will become exceptions in future versions of Python.

By using the builtin ``venv`` module, these issues can be avoided.


Installation & Usage
--------------------

To use tox-venv, install it alongside tox in your environment. Then, run ``tox`` as normal - no configuration necessary.

.. code-block::

    $ pip install tox tox-venv
    $ tox

If you have already ran tox, it's necessary to recreate the test envs. Either run ``tox --recreate``, or delete the
``.tox`` directory.


Compatibility
-------------

tox-venv is compatible with both Python 2 and 3, however it only creates test environments in Python 3.3 and later.
Python 3.3 environments are only partially compatible, as not all options (such as ``--copies``/``--symlinks``) were
supported. Environments for Python 3.4 and later are fully compatible.


Release process
---------------

* Update changelog
* Update package version in setup.py
* Create git tag for version
* Upload release to PyPI

.. code-block::

    $ pip install -U setuptools wheel
    $ rm -rf dist/ build/
    $ python setup.py bdist_wheel upload
